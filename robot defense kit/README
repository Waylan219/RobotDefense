1 A. 
    We looked throught the files to see where the actions are being created. We found
    out that the actions were being created with 8 different directions and 1 power
    setting and being put into a variable called potentials. Here we added an action
    to be able to set the power to 1 (off) and just point it a random direction 
    since it was off and didn't matter.

1 B.
    With the way we approached 1 A we changed the static function to include all 32 
    possible actions with all 4 power settings and all 8 directions. That way it can 
    turn off and consider power settings
